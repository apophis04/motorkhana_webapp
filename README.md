## Assumptions
1. **Age Limit for Junior Drivers:**
   - Junior drivers must be less than 18 years old.
   - There is a specific category or classification for drivers under 18 years of age.

2. **Overall Result Calculation:**
   - Overall standings of drivers are determined by their cumulative course completion times.

3. **Top 5 Drivers Graph:**
   - The graph visualizes the performance of drivers based on the number of runs they have completed.

## Design Decisions
- Initially, I attempted to create a state-of-the-art design where multiple functionalities were integrated into a single page/code/route. However, I encountered difficulties, such as database update issues and handling errors.
- To address these challenges, I opted to create different routes and separate HTML templates for each specific case. For example, I initially tried to combine the "overall_result" and "top5graph" functionalities on a single page. Due to the complexity, I decided to separate them, allowing for easier handling and management of the functionalities.

## Database Questions
1. **SQL Statement to Create the "car" Table:**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS car
   (
   car_num INT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
   model VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
   drive_class VARCHAR(3) NOT NULL
   );
   ```
   This statement creates the "car" table with fields for car number, model, and drive class.

2. **Setting up Relationship Between "car" and "driver" Tables:**
   - The "car" field in the "driver" table references the "car_num" field in the "car" table, establishing a relationship between drivers and their cars.

   ```sql
   FOREIGN KEY (car) REFERENCES car(car_num)
   ON UPDATE CASCADE
   ON DELETE CASCADE
   ```

3. **Inserting Mini and GR Yaris Details into the "car" Table:**
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO car VALUES
   (11, 'Mini', 'FWD'),
   (17, 'GR Yaris', '4WD');
   ```
   Inserts car details for Mini and GR Yaris into the "car" table.

4. **Setting Default Value for

 "driver_class" Field:**
   - To set a default value of 'RWD' for the "driver_class" field in the "car" table, you can modify the table creation statement like this:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS car
   (
   car_num INT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
   model VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
   drive_class VARCHAR(3) DEFAULT 'RWD' NOT NULL
   );
   ```

5. **Importance of Different Routes for Drivers and Club Admin:**
   - Different routes are crucial for maintaining data privacy, functionality control, and security.
   - Allowing unauthorized users to access admin routes could lead to unintended changes to the system and expose sensitive information.
